# ABOUT ME 

<img src="https://github.com/fawaz70/fawaz70.github.io/blob/gh-pages/fawaz1.jpg?raw=true" width="375" height="375">

I am a recent graduate from the University of Toronto, with an Honors Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, specializing in Software Engineering.

I have acquired many valuable technical skills, as a Computer Scientist. I have thorough knowledge of Python, Java, C, and SQL. With the help of multiple projects, I was able to gain strong skills in Agile methodologies. Apart from these, my keen interest in front-end development has allowed me to learn other languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XML. Over the years, I was also able to strengthen theoretical aspects of Computer Science, including Object-Oriented Programming, Space-Time Complexity, and Memory Management.

To compliment my technical skills, I was able to strengthen my interpersonal, communication and leadership skills, which I obtained while leading projects as a Junior Business Analyst at Environment Canada.

During my personal time, I enjoy reading, watching documentaries, and the great outdoors.

## EXOPLANET DATABASE
<hr color="white">

The objective of the project was to provide updates the clients personal OpenExoplanet Catalogue-which carries information about various planets outside our solar system. We took the clients personal database and added to it the NASA database as well as the exoplanet EU database. This project requires the program to provide upgrades to the catalogue as new planet discoveries are made. For successful operation of this project, various tools and skills were required, which are described below:
 
<li> Operated with a team of 5 developers in an agile environment to provide updates to the catalogue based on new planet discoveries </li>
<li> With the use of <b>Python</b> and various libraries such as parser was used convert new discovered data into OE compatible data for merge request </li>
<li> Strong knowledge in <b>algorithm design</b> and <b>data structures</b> was used in order to read and parse new planet information to save time complexity </li>
<li> For testing phase of the project, unit and integration testing approach was used to ensure correct operation of the functionalities </li>
<li> Conducting weekly sprint meetings to ensure the progress and future obstacles of the project was a crucial aspect of the project </li>
<li> <b>Github</b> was used as a code respository and Slack used as primary communication </li>

## MATPLOTLIB-CONTRIBUTION
<hr color="white">

The Objective of the project was to analyze bugs in <b>Matplotlib</b>-data plotting library in <b>Python</b>. Furthurmore, analyze the code and the design in order to provide an efficient fix to the bug.
 
<li> In a team of 8 developers set in an agile environment conducting analysis on the matplotlib to locate the bug </li>
<li> Extensive analysis was required on the library in order to further determine the design pattern of the bug </li>
<li> Various roles are played throughout different phases of the project, including scrum, developer and tester </li>
<li> Using different tools such as Trello and Github for task board and main respository respectively </li>
<li> In order to ensure completion of the bug, extensive unit and integration testing were performed </li>
<li> Strong communication, leadership and project management skills were acquired through weekly scrum meetings </li>

## UX DESIGN PROJECT
<hr color="white">

Objective of the project was to analyze the current TTC website to determine any user experience heuristics violations. Throughout the project, conduct an analysis report regarding the design and present the findings of the analysis
 
<li> In a group of 4, analyze the website for user experience characteristics for certain functionalities </li>
<li> Conduct weekly meetings to dicuss the research findings of each functionality in the website </li>
<li> Perform different methods of surveys of the website users to further understand user experience </li>
<li> Provide an demo solution for the chosen functionalities to improve user experience using the <b>Justinmind</b> tool </li>
<li> We wrote and presented analysis reports to the remaining groups with the use of my strong effective communication skills </li>

## FLIGHT ITINERARY
<hr color="white">

Objective of the project was to design a flight itinerary application using <b>Android Studio</b> and <b>Java</b>. In this application, we designed an algorithm that would take the shortest path from one destination to another(Ex. Toronto to Dubai).
 
<li> Implemented a shortest path algorithm to search for flights and store the information into a CSV file with the use of <b>Java, Android Studio, Subversion, Objected Oriented Programming and Observer Design Pattern</b> </li>
<li> Interacted closely with three other members within a four-month timeframe designing the android front and backend </li>

## ONLINE WEB ART GALLARY
<hr color="white">

Objective of the project was to design a website from scratch that allows the user to upload/delete pictures which is stored into a database, which then the user can add/delete comments for each picture. 
 
<li> Implemented the entire front-end using <b>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</b> </li>
<li> Designed the entire back-end using <b>NodeJs</b> </li>
